The analysis processes the text to evaluate its sentiment, providing a detailed score breakdown. 
## Positive Score indicates the count of positive words.
## Negative Score indicates the count of negative words.
## Polarity Score is calculated as the normalized difference between positive and negative scores, ranging from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive).
